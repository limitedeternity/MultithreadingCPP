# Thread Local Data

Thread-local data, also known as thread-local storage, will be created for each thread separately. It behaves like static data because itâ€™s bound for the lifetime of the thread and it will be created at its first usage. Also, thread-local data belongs exclusively to the thread.

```cpp
thread_local std::string hello("hello from ");
std::mutex cout_mutex;

void thread_func(const std::string_view thread_name) {
    hello.append(thread_name);

    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> guard(cout_mutex);
    std::cout << hello << std::endl;
    std::cout << "&hello: " << &hello << std::endl;
}
```

> Thread-local data helps to port a single-threaded program to a multithreaded environment. If global variables are thread-local, there is a guarantee that each thread will get its own copy of the data. Due to this fact, there is no shared mutable state which may cause a data race resulting in undefined behavior.
